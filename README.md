# Simple GSM Project for Arduino
Description

This project provides a simple code to operate a GSM module with an Arduino board. The project aims to offer an easy and quick way to start using GSM modules in Arduino projects, such as sending and receiving SMS and making and receiving calls.
Features

    Send SMS: Send text messages to any phone number.
    Receive SMS: Receive text messages from any phone number.
    Make Calls: Make voice calls to any phone number.
    Receive Calls: Receive incoming calls from any phone number.

Requirements

    Arduino board (such as Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.).
    GSM module (such as SIM900, SIM800, etc.).
    SoftwareSerial library (if not already included in the Arduino code).

Installation

    Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
    Open the project file in the Arduino IDE.
    Upload the code to your Arduino board.

Usage

    Connect the GSM module to the Arduino board according to the connections specified in the code.
    Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to monitor incoming and outgoing SMS and calls.
    Use the available commands to send and receive SMS and make and receive calls.
